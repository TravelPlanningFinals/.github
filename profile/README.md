Lets Go is an application developed over a 2-week coding spring. Designed for all of the Tour Guides in us to help coordinate a trip with our remote friends.

With the ability to input and track Guests coming, Flights, Lodging, find Entertainment, and count down the days to the Trip, Lets Go allows you to put all your important information in one place.

Our project consists of virtually all things we have learned at Alchemy Code Lab. Context is used to manage user and trip data throughout the application, to include flights, guests, lodging, and more.

All data is rendered and updated in real-time, allowing us to host the entire application at one URL location after login and trip creation.

Our frontend React.js Repo, as well as our backend API were all created from the ground up. Our back end consists of 5 Tables hosting users, Guests, Trips, Flights, and Lodging. Each member had a piece in creating the back end through creating modules & controllers, testing, and connecting to the front end.

Through the use of Joins and separate tables, we were able to connect all information through or Trips table, being the hub of our backend.

The Front end, each member also had a hand in coding logic and design of the UX. State is handled in context as it is edited, created, and updated throughout the application. Login is handled through GitHub OAuth.
